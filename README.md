### This is the front end for an ecommerce site
Created with react no backend just state, routes and query parameters.

This project was for me to learn react and show off some front end skills since my
other projects don't really do that.

### Features
- Routes for index page, product page, cart page.
- Add items to cart, select quantity for items.
- Remove items from cart.
- Looks good on all screen sizes.
